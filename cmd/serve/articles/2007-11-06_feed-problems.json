Moving to a new\nsystem caused all the GIDs to be different, so all the old articles showed up\nas new in readers.  Also, I'm fairly new to Django, so I forgot things like\n\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;pub date\u0026quot; in the Feed class (I know, I'm an idiot), so all\nthe feeds showed up in the incorrect order on http://www.openclue.org\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I think I've finally gotten it all figured out, so hopefully you\nshouldn't see these oddities anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
