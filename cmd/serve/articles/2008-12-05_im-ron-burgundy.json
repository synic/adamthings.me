The machine in\nquestion has a 3ware SATA RAID controller, which in turn has a configuration\nutility which I used to set up a few volumes.  Once the configuration was\ncomplete, I saved it, and exited.  At this point, the controller had to clear\nthe drives of data, and because all 16 drives are 1.5TB drives, it was taking\nforever.  I started this process in the morning, and by the time I left, it was\nonly at around 45% complete.\n\n--\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.vimtips.org/media/images/0d.jpg\" align=\"right\"\u003e So\nyesterday, I started working on putting together a 16 drive storage machine\nthat will serve as a temporary backup for the holidays.

It said nothing other than \"OD\"\nand had a button for \"OK\".  Yeah.  The only way this could be more awesome is\nif the \"OK\" had a question mark after it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"restored-from-archive\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3\u003eRestored from VimTips archive\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  This article was restored from the VimTips archive.
